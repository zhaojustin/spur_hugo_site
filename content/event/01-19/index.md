title: Architecture of L2 platforms

summary: In this session, we discussed different L2 architectures and how these various designs aim to address the scaling problem of L1. We particularly focused on factors contributing to efficiency gains (such as reduced decentralization, transaction bundling, decreased congestion, and off-chain computation) and how these measures will impact transaction fees and the long-term stability of the platforms.
