title: Business models of L2 platforms

summary: On most L2 platforms, the transaction fees users pay consist of a fee for the verification of their transaction on the L2 network and a fee to publish its proof on the L1 network. Since the L1 fees depend on congestion at the time the proof of an L2 transaction bundle is published on the L1, L2 platforms can generate profits if the fees they charge surpass their operational costs and the L1 fees they pay. In this session, we discussed under what circumstances an L2 platform can establish a viable business model.
