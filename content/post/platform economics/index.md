# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: The development of Blockchains technologies, including smart contracts and cryptographic tokens, have a potential to change the competition between platforms. In this presentation, based on a couple of projects, I discuss how utility tokens can help new platforms enter the market, and how governance tokens can help platforms to increase social welfare. I also discuss limitations of these technologies in improving platform strategy and competition.
