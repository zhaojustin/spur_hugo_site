# Summary for listings and search engines
summary: "Blockchain technologies are designed to promote decentralization and self-governance in economic and social settings. In the context of platforms, an early claim of some
proponents of these technologies was that blockchains would promote disintermediation,
replacing intermediaries with decentralized governance, for instance leading to
platforms governed by decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs)."
